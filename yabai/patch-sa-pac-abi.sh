# Patch the yabai scripting-addition loader's PAC ABI from v1 (0x81) to v0 (0x80)
# so it can inject into Sequoia's Dock.app. Re-run after every `brew upgrade yabai`.
# Source: https://github.com/asmvik/yabai/issues/2686
#
# Usage:
#   sudo yabai --load-sa     # may fail with "protection failure" — run anyway to install loader
#   sudo ~/Dotfiles/yabai/patch-sa-pac-abi.sh
#   sudo yabai --load-sa     # should succeed silently this time
